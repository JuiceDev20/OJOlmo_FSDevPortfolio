Full Stack Developer Portfolio 

A nice project for week 1!

This project was fun and exciting from begining to end. 
The template provided sufficient structure to meet the project timeline while 
allowing customization to make it my own.

Thank you for taking the time to read this document, I hope you like it and please feel free to share your thoughts.
